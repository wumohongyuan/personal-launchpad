## 📐 Responsive 12-Column Layout

- **12-Column Adaptive Grid**: Automatically reflows and scales proportionately based on viewport width, providing a native visual layout on both desktop ultrawide monitors and mobile devices.
- **WYSIWYG Layout Editing**:
  - Click **Edit Layout** in the header to enter arrangement mode.
  - Drag cards with a mouse, or drag their title/grip on touchscreens. Insertion markers support rows, columns, and gaps; dragging near the view edge scrolls automatically. Press Esc to cancel.
  - Drag the corner handle to resize; width snaps to columns and height to rows, with a live size badge (height only on narrow screens, Esc cancels). Footer buttons and arrow keys on the focused handle step the size too. Edit mode shows 12 column guides.
  - Easily move forward, move backward, duplicate, or delete any widget.
- **Multi-Page Management**:
  - Click `+` at the end of the tab bar at any time to create distinct pages (e.g., "Work Dashboard", "Life Log", "Project Hub").
  - Drag page tabs to reorder in edit mode. Right-click tabs to rename, move left/right, or delete pages.
- **JSON Import & Export**: One-click copy and paste of complete dashboard layouts for easy backup and cross-vault migration.

## 🔌 Host API for Plugin Developers

Home Pages exposes a lightweight host API allowing other Obsidian plugins to register custom widgets and views into the homepage framework:

```ts
// Retrieve the API instance when Home Pages is loaded (or listen to "home-pages:ready")
const api = app.plugins.plugins["home-pages"]?.api;

// 1. Register a new widget type
const unregister = api.registerWidget(myWidgetDefinition, "my-plugin-id");

// 2. Programmatically pin a widget to the current homepage
api.pinWidget("my-widget-kind", { ref: "note-path" }, {
  title: "My Pinned View",
  w: 6,
  h: 4,
  provider: "my-plugin-id"
});

// 3. Trigger a dashboard redraw when underlying data changes
api.refresh("my-widget-kind");

// 4. Utilize consistent UI rendering helpers
api.ui.renderKpi(containerEl, { label: "Completed", value: 12 });
api.ui.renderEmpty(containerEl, { message: "No data available" });
```

> **Integration Example:** **Duowei Table (duowei-table-pro ≥ 1.4.0)** registers `duowei-view` via the Host API. Users can right-click any table view tab and select "Pin to Homepage" to display live calendars, kanban boards, and progress timelines on their homepage.

## 🧩 User-Defined Custom Widgets (Folder-based & Hot-Reload)

Users can build custom widgets directly in JavaScript without creating separate plugins:

1. In plugin settings, navigate to **"Custom Widgets"**.
2. Set the **"Custom Widgets Folder"** (e.g. `_scripts/home-pages/`), or click **"📄 Create Demo Widget Template"** to auto-generate `demo-widget.js`.
3. Create or edit `.js` files exporting a standard widget definition:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     kind: "user-clock",
     name: "Custom Clock",
     description: "Real-time clock widget",
     icon: "clock",
     accent: "#6366f1",
     defaultSize: { w: 4, h: 3 },
     defaultConfig: () => ({ greeting: "Hello" }),
     render(body, ctx) {
       body.empty();
       const el = body.createDiv();
       el.setText(`${ctx.config.greeting} · ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`);
       ctx.registerInterval(() => {
         el.setText(`${ctx.config.greeting} · ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`);
       }, 1000);
     }
   };
   ```
4. **Save and it appears**: The first time a new script loads, its widget is added to the current page (once per widget; editing a script after you removed its card does not add it back; turn off with **Add new custom widgets automatically**).
5. **Live Hot-Reload**: Save modifications to your `.js` file from Obsidian or an external editor like VS Code, and homepage cards will **automatically reload and re-render instantly**!

## 🔒 Data & Privacy

- **100% Local Storage:** All dashboard configurations, layout JSONs, pomodoro records, and habits are stored locally in `data.json`.
- **Zero Telemetry:** The plugin does not collect usage analytics, telemetry, or user metrics.
- **Network Requests:** Weather queries are only initiated when a weather-enabled banner is rendered:
  - CMA Station requests public endpoints without keys.
  - Open-Meteo and QWeather only connect when explicitly selected and configured.
- **Bundle Integrity:** A fail-closed security gate (`scripts/verify-bundle.mjs`) ensures the distributed bundle contains no dynamic script generation, `eval()`, or `new Function()`.

## ❓ FAQ

### Will layout break on mobile devices?
No. Home Pages provides responsive adaptive rules for small screens. On narrow viewports, the grid seamlessly collapses into full-width or compact columns optimized for touch interaction.

### Does the Pomodoro timer keep running if I switch notes or restart Obsidian?
Yes. The timer state and start timestamp are persisted in plugin memory and data. Switching views or restarting Obsidian restores the timer seamlessly.

### How do I restore the default initial layout?
In **Settings → Home Pages → Pages**, click **＋ New Default Page** at any time to generate a clean instance of the default layout.
